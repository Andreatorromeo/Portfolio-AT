            I wanted to create my first portfolio website 
            comprehensive of my main projects made during 
            the master at the Scuola Politecnica di Design.

            After designing it with Adobe XD, 
            I used HTML, CSS, JS for the creation of this website,
            currently it's hosted by Netlify and Github.

            The homepage is composed by four sections which are 
            linked in the navbarwith relative links. I wanted to create a ripetitive
            scheme of the background simple and clean using the meta-elements.

            I wanted to have the same HTML structure for projects pages.
            The challenge at this point was to create a scheme which was good
            for all my projects without breaking any flow

            For this project I learned to use GitHub for the creation of repositories,

            As software for the codes, I used Visual Studio Code.
