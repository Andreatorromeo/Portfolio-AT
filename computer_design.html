          <p class="pject_text_content">
            For my Computer Design course at the SPD, one of the projects was to
            explore a specific function of Photoshop and then create a poster
            -for printing and digital- visually and metaphorically related to
            the chosen tool. Another limit was the possibility to use only one
            picture.

          <p class="pject_text_content">
            My approach was to select a picture that could be easily manipulated
            and then creating a whole concept basing on what that pictures meant
            to me
