          Wether you’re looking to book a romantic dinner, an exotic night out,
          or a relaxing dinner with friends, you will find every option
          available on TheFork. An easy to use design allows foodies to filter
          restaurants based on preference, consult reviews and instantly book
          online.

          <h2>Product vision</h2>
          <p class="sub-content">
            In 2007, when Steven Premutico founded Dimmi (TheFork), his main
            inspiration was the enhancement of the moment when we find our-
            selves around a table sharing food. Nowadays in a few seconds using
            our smartphones we can book a table, understand if the restaurant
            has our favorite foods and know how to get there. TheFork tries to
            simplify these steps and tries to give the best booking experience
            for the user, removing the most annoying part of a dinner or a
            lunch.

        <div>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p class="sub-content">
            User standards are always increasing, precisely because the needs
            are manifold and finding a common denominator between users becomes
            extremely complex. Finding and introducing features which cover the
            most required needs of specific users can become difficult,
            especially without transforming the global user experience in a
            painful journey.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
          <p class="sub-content">
            Based on the research and the frictions between the app and the
            user, our team come up with some interesting features such as the
            preorder, a new batch for the authentic cuisine and new filters
            during the food research. Preordering means choosing and paying the
            meals for the registered guests and yourself when finalizing the
            booking process. Upon arriving to the restaurant, your meals will
            arrive to your table without any waiting time.

          After comprehending the generic usage of TheFork, we started with the
          first users testing to understand any kind of friction and the
          eventual presence of what are commonly called “Gulfs of Execution” and
          “Gulf of Evaluation”.
          <br />
          <br />
          We read the reviews to have a clue on some direct feedback of typical
          users and we conducted new researches basing on the reviews results.
          On the other hand we conducted surveys and interviews to confirm the
          results obtained through the user testing and by reading the reviews.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the significant things we discovered, is that around 30% of
          bookings are made for the upcoming three hours and a large part of
          those users are workers and often, they have a small time window for
          eating and they don’t want to wait for the preparation of the meal
          upon arriving to the restaurant.

          <br />
          <br />
          A large part of the users used the app abroad or in different cities
          and wanted to try typical cuisine. TheFork doesn’t give the
          possibility to find restaurants that offer typical dishes of the
          user’s specific location. The user has to look for pictures and the
          menu of the restaurant and the research could get boring,
          time-consuming and couldn’t yield any result
        </p>

          Basing on demographic and ethnographic results we were able to create
          three different personas. Travelers looking for typical cuisine,
          workers with tight schedules and people who change their plan. Our
          research and design were developed before the update of TheFork which
          introduced the possibility to edit a reservation.

          As always the flows were followed by lo-fi wireframes but in this case
          we had many limitations due to the fact we weren't redisigning the
          whole app. One of the most intricated part of the designing process
          was the prototyping. We had to link between them many screens and
          often they were nested.

          Our final prototype was validated through user testing which involved
          7 different users. We pointed out different tasks with different
          goals. The task needed a scenario to motivate user, avoiding abstract
          situation. We observed almost entirely positive feedback, especially
          for the “preorder” feature which was the most complex.
