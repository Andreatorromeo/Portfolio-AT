          <p class="sub-content">
            In this project there are several major challenges, the first thing
            to keep in mind is that dashboards aren’t meant to show everything
            at hand upfront, understanding what info users want to see is
            crucial for a functional and efficient dashboard.

          <p class="sub-content">
            <br />
            Choosing the right graph for the content is another important step,
            but could be the trickiest part, because it’s not so easy
            understanding the right visual tool to represent a metric.

          <h2>4. Design</h2>
          Starting from the lo-fi wireframes we created the final prototype

          For this project I used a different approach, I decided to conduct
          immediately some user testing to better figure out what the mains
          frustrations and expectations are. An effective dashboard design
          requires understanding user’s goals, the context of use, timeliness
          and interactivity requirements. To do this, after testing the users, I
          interviewed a small number of users (5) and I asked them questions to
          better understand demographic data, what triggers them to look into a
          dashboard, in what context would they review the dashboard, how often
          do they review metrics etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          What emerged from the research was not a problem only of the
          dashboard, but an issue with the navbar too. Generally speaking,
          having two different menus, (in this case, if you observe the picture
          below we are talking about the hamburger and my activities) can
          confuse the user because there is no hierarchy which links them,
          except for the path in the blue bar. Furthermore, in the homepage,
          when the hamburger menu is opened, it overrides the page and the user
          can’t navigate the page anymore.

          asing on the results obtained during the research, I could make a user
          persona and the typical user’s journey, where i could track pain
          points, opportunities and motivations of the customer. In this phase,
          due to the needs of the users, I decided to opt for an Analytical
          dashboards which is used to present key data sets to the user, always
          reflected against previous performance. Analytical dashboards should
          be data-centric, and show as many relevant data views as is feasible.

          The flows were followed by the making of lo-fi wireframes and then the
          hi-fi mockup. I created a library on Sketch which gives the chance to
          keep a consistence design for future editing and new features
