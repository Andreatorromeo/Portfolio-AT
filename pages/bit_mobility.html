          BIT mobility is a Mobile App available for iOS and Android that offers
          dock-free electric scooters rentals to fulfill short distance urban
          trips. in Italy, especially during the COVID-19 emergency, e-scooters
          are becoming largely used to avoid public transportation and reduce
          the chances of infection.

          <h2>Product vision</h2>
          <p class="sub-content">
            In Italy BIT it’s also a new way to avoid the traffic of the city
            but often the user is either afraid to rent an e-scooter, or he
            finds himself confused by the procedure to follow, specially when he
            has no time to waste due to the job schedule or an appointment. The
            long term goal is to make possible the daily utilization of the
            scooters instead of public transport still giving a great experience
            to the “casual users”.

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p class="sub-content">
            The two main challenges are:<br />
            - setting the research to understand what are the pain points,
            frictions, goals and expectations of the user.<br />
            - reducing the gap between BIT and the user, enhancing the only
            “contact point” between them: the mobile app.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Outcomes</h2>
          <p class="sub-content">
            Based on the findings from both UX research and user testing
            sessions I were able to come up with a list of changes and new
            features. At this point has been necessary to design a new
            experience for the user and a new interface.

          A strong research and an accurate analysis is crucial to set a valid

          <h2>3. Emphatyzation</h2>
          Basing on the research I created different users archetypes to better
          understands user's journey, flows and frictions.

          Starting from the lo-fi wireframes I created the final prototype
          basing on the research made and the whole design system.

          The research is the foundation of the whole design so it requires a
          wide range of tools to identify problems and needs of the users. In
          this project I conducted user testing, surveys, interviews and read
          the reviews on the Apple store and Google play. Plus I made an
          accurate study of the competitors features and different onboarding
          procedures.

          <br />
          <br />

          I conducted the surveys using Google Forms and 22 responses was
          collected. Surveys and interviews was useful to better understand who
          is the user and what are his goals and to gather the results of
          demographic and ethnographic research.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the many unexpected results was that a large number of the
          users give more importance to the procedure which brings them to rent
          the e-scooter and not to the physical usage of the scooter itself, due
          to the fact that nowadays the physical service has a high standard
          level between all the competitors. Limited Payment methods, long
          procedure to create an account and individuating the e-scooter are
          just some of the problems emerged.

          This phase of the process was dedicated to the study of the
          demographic and ethnographic results. Basing on that I created three
          different personas: the habitual user, the casual user and the user
          who’s using e-scooters for funny. A crucial step was to delineate the
          map of typical journey of those different users and to understand
          their flows in the usage of Bit. This phase was useful to identify
          other pain points and exact areas for opportunity development.

          To bring to life the needed changes emerged during the research and
          analysis phase was necessary to strategically think the user
          experience and finalize it into a new design. Below are showed the
          major steps taken in the design process.

          The user testing was conducted on a sample of 5 users. What emerged
          was a better experience for the creation of the account and the
          onboarding procedure. Also, the payment system were more clear if
          compared to the old version of BIT (which is still the one avaible on
          the stores). Another interesting result was the reaction to the tab
          bar at the bottom, I took a dangerous step by removing the classic
          "burger menu" but all the users were satisfied by how intuitive and
          easy to reach is the tab bar. On the other hand one user on five had
          some difficult to understand the difference between the wallet and the
          direct payment.
